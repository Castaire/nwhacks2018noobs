# nwhacks2018noobs
## About
We are a team of 3 who knew nothing about blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies and tried to build something using it in 24 hours! This project is our nwHacks 2018 submission :) 

We built a platform that targets users who are looking to travel with more people. A user can either post their travel plans or they can look at submitted plans and find the one most suitable for them.
The platform has features that will handle secure transactions to allow multi-person funding of a travel plan, as well as accomodating for payments in cryptocurrency (currently only supports Ethereum!).
